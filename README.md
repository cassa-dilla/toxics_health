# Toxics Release and Health Disparities: Mapping America

 This project explores the correlation between toxic chemical releases and health disparities in the United States. By analyzing county-level data, it finds a weak correlation between on-site toxics release totals and child mortality outcomes for American Indian/Alaska Native populations.

## Background
Toxic chemical releases threaten environmental and public health worldwide. Exposure to toxic air, water, soil, and chemical pollution is the largest environmental cause of premature death (Global Alliance on Health and Pollution). This project focuses on the United States, exploring county health outcomes correlated with the release of toxics, as well as the possibility of using health data and machine learning to predict which counties have released the most total toxics.
